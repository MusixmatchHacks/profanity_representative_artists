Let's find out.</p> <img src=images/genres.65d7bc3e.jpg> <div class="figure-title text-uppercase"> <p>Genres studied</p> </div> <p>Eight popular genres were chosen for simplifying the analysis. For each genre, the most googled artists were selected and the lyrics of their studio-albums were considered for analysis. This leads to the following dataset.</p> <img src=images/overview.07454246.jpg> <div class="figure-title text-uppercase"> <p>Data overview</p> </div> <p>The lyrics in the dataset were scanned for the frequency of occurrence of each swear word from <a href=https://gist.github.com/MusixmatchHacks/3a4dd893be05093bf277>this</a> list. The creation of this list was explained <a href=http://lab.musixmatch.com/profanity_genres/#analysis>previously</a>.</p> <h1 class=heading> <span>Overall swear word usage</span> </h1> <p> An average of 0.66% of all words in lyrics of these artists are swear words. 1 in every 152 words is a swear word.

Hip-Hop artists dominate both of these categories (d'oh). Overall, the most used swear words are nigga/s/z, shit, fuck and bitch.</p> <h1 class=heading> <span>Highest swear word count in lyrics</span> </h1> <p>Amongst the 361 artists studied, <b>Lil Wayne has the highest count of swear words in his lyrics</b>. He is followed closely by Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes and T.I. This analysis is skewed by artists who have released more albums but the next metric tries to counter this.</p> <img src=images/overall_top_profane-total.8ad3700b.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Most frequent use of swear words</span> </h1> <p><b>Chief Keef uses swear words most frequently</b> amongst the 361 artists studied. There is 1 profanity for every 20 words in his lyrics. He is followed by Dr. Dre, N.W.A. (Dr. Dre is a member), ASAP Rocky and Young Thug. </p> <img src=images/overall_top_profane.63b4df55.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Heavy Metal </span> </h1> <p>Heavy Metal is the second most profane genre. Korn, Slipknot and Children of Bodom use profanity most frequently.</p> <img src=images/top_profane_genres-metal.d514b5f1.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Electronic music</span> </h1> <p>Despite being mostly instrumental Electronic artists seem to pack a lot of swear words in their music. Diplo leads the rankings here followed by Ryuichi Sakamoto and DeadMau5.</p> <img src=images/top_profane_genres-electronic.9ba17667.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Rock</span> </h1> <p>There is a marked decrease in the profanity frequency of the rest of the genres as compared to Hip-Hop, Heavy Metal and Electronic. Amongst the rock artists, Green Day and Red Hot Chili Peppers use profanity most frequently. The most used swear words are different for both.</p> <img src=images/top_profane_genres-rock.9b81721d.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Pop</span> </h1> <p>Pop lyrics are known for their wide appeal and use very few swear words. Amongst the most searched pop artists, Charli XCX uses most profanity followed by Tove Lo and Mark Ronson.</p> <img src=images/top_profane_genres-pop.48e46179.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Indie Rock</span> </h1> <p>The Neighbourhood is band using most profanity amongst the Indie rockers. They are followed by Modest Mouse and Kings of Leon. The most commonly used swear word is shit followed by fuck.</p> <img src=images/top_profane_genres-indie.278885fb.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Folk</span> </h1> <p>There is a marked decrease in the usage of profanity in Folk and Country as compared to the above genres. Loudon Wainwright III and Joni Mitchell use swear words most frequently.</p> <img src=images/top_profane_genres-folk.19035a87.jpg> <h1 class=heading> <span>Country</span> </h1> <p>Country is the least profane genre amongst the 8 popular genres studied.

        <span>Hiphop lyrics use most profanity</span>
      </h3>

      <p>1 in every 47 words in Hiphop lyrics is a swear word. This also means <b>every Hiphop song has 10 profanities on average</b>.</p>
      <p>The top 3 swear words used are nigga, shit and niggas. But the 'n word' is generally not used in an offensive context in Hiphop. On removing it alongwith its conjugations from the analysis of Hiphop lyrics, 1 in every 74 words is a swear word in
        Hiphop lyrics. This still means 6 profanities in every song. Even with this reduction hip hop still remains the most profane genre overall.</p>

      <h3 class='sub_heading'>
        <span>Heavy metal and Electronic</span>
      </h3>
      <p>Heavy metal lyrics are known for their aggressive and violent imagery. So its no surprise it takes 2<sup>nd</sup> rank here.</p>
      <p>Even though Electronic music is mostly instrumental but it still ranks third. </p>

        <span>The least profane</span>
      </h3>

      <p>Pop, Indie Rock and Rock have comparable profanity frequencies (1 in every 1000 words). For every 4 songs on average for these genres we would find 1 profanity.</p>
      <p>Folk lyrics have 1 swear word for every 2925 words while for Country lyrics this is 1 for every 4438 words. <b>This also means that for every 22 Folk songs and every 20 Country songs we can find 1 profanity</b>. This is very less compared to Hiphop.
      </p> --> </section> <section class=conclusion> <h1 class=heading> <span>Conclusion</span> </h1> <p>As expected, Hip-hop artists are the most profane amongst popular artists. Lil Wayne has the highest count of swear words in his lyrics while Chief Keef uses swear words most frequently. Heavy metal follows Hip-Hop but the frequency of swear words is quite less compared to Hip-Hop. Korn and Slipknot are the most profane Heavy metal bands. Folk and Country artists use the least profanity.</p> <p>Some themes and moments in songs call for usage of swear words but it is difficult to distinguish these from the cases where swear words are used just for the sake of it. This is an attempt to study profanity from a statistical point of view and another way to look at the works of our favourite artists.</p> <p> Please <a href=#subscribe_bottom>subscribe</a> to our mailing list to be notified of new articles.</p> <div id=article_end class=text-center>. . .</div> </section> <section class="social first_section"> <a name=subscribe_bottom></a> <div class="ssk-sm ssk-group ssk-count" data-url="http://lab.musixmatch.com/profanity_representative_artists/" data-text="" data-via=Musixmatch> <a href="" class="ssk ssk-facebook"></a> <a href="" class="ssk ssk-twitter"></a> </div> <div class="sign-up center-block"> <div id=mc_embed_signup> <form action="//musixmatch.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4b3001a7018f0f85c4658b0c7&amp;id=222b95fbdf" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class=validate target=_blank novalidate> <div id=mc_embed_signup_scroll> <h2></h2> <!-- <div class="indicates-required">
