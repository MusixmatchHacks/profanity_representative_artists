This also means <b>every Hiphop song has 10 profanities on average</b>.</p> <p>The top 3 swear words used are nigga, shit and niggas. But the 'n word' is generally not used in an offensive context in Hiphop. On removing it alongwith its conjugations from the analysis of Hiphop lyrics, 1 in every 74 words is a swear word in Hiphop lyrics. This still means 6 profanities in every song. Even with this reduction hip hop still remains the most profane genre overall.</p> <img src=images/hiphop.da831395.jpg> <div class="figure-title text-uppercase"> <p>Hiphop - with and without the 'n word'</p> </div> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Heavy metal and Electronic</span> </h3> <p>Heavy metal lyrics are known for their aggressive and violent imagery. So its no surprise it takes 2<sup>nd</sup> rank here.</p> <p>Even though Electronic music is mostly instrumental but it still ranks third. </p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>The least profane</span> </h3> <p>Pop, Indie Rock and Rock have comparable profanity frequencies (1 in every 1000 words). For every 4 songs on average for these genres we would find 1 profanity.</p> <p>Folk lyrics have 1 swear word for every 2925 words while for Country lyrics this is 1 for every 4438 words. <b>This also means that for every 22 Folk songs and every 20 Country songs we can find 1 profanity</b>. This is very less compared to Hiphop. </p> </section> <section class=conclusion> <h1 class=heading> <span>Conclusion</span> </h1> <p>The usage of profanity in lyrics is comparable to it's usage in every day speech. Also, 185 swear words account for 99% of all swearing in lyrics. With respect to these words, we found that Hiphop lyrics are the most profane.</p> <p> While researching this article, we understood that defining profanity is a problematic (and sometimes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBH5oNQOS0">funny</a>) issue and it depends a lot on contextual factors (culture, geography, importance to the narrative, etc). On the flipside, it is also possible to be highly offensive without ever using any profanities. This study is merely a statistical analysis of lyrics and a way to contrast the writing styles of different genres. </p> <p>Our next article will compare popular artists by their usage of profanity.

The first idea was to just consider the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words>Seven Dirty Words</a>. We were interested in this because of the historical importance of this list, but a lot of swear words more commonly found in lyrics would be missed.</p> <p>Since FCC is the body censoring broadcasts in the USA, we looked up their <a href=https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/obscenity-indecency-profanity-faq>website</a> hoping to find a more general list of profanities or even a generic definition of profanity. Instead they have this ambiguous description:</p> <blockquote>The FCC would consider the F-Word and those words (or variants thereof) that are as highly offensive as the F-Word to be profane language that cannot be broadcast between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. <a href=https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/obscenity-indecency-profanity-faq><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote> <p>In the end we decided to use <a href=https://gist.github.com/ryanlewis/a37739d710ccdb4b406d>this</a> list of profanities as a starting point. It is a list which was used by Google for filtering user input for one of its <a href="http://www.wdyl.com/">projects</a>. We removed some of the very specific phrases found in that list to arrive at <a href=https://gist.github.com/MusixmatchHacks/3a4dd893be05093bf277#file-mxm_profanity_list-txt>this</a>. These 437 swear words were used for the study.</p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Representative artists for genres</span> </h3> <p>We used the list of representative artists from our <a href=http://lab.musixmatch.com/vocabulary_genres/#analysis_details>previous article</a>. For Pop and Electronic music some artists (Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Iggy Azalea, Pharrell Williams, Madonna, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Wiz Khalifa, Drake), who mainly belong to the Hiphop genre, were distorting the results. So we removed them from the list of representative artists for Pop and Electronic. Whether these artists should be classified as Pop/Electronic as well as Hiphop is another discussion altogether.</p> <h3 class=sub_heading> <span>Alternate graphical representations</span> </h3> <p>We considered a few other ways to represent the data.</p> <img src=images/genres-comparison-sankey.ce8aee4a.jpg> <div class="figure-title text-uppercase"> <p>Sankey chart</p> </div> <p>The frequency numbers are heavily dominated by Hip hop and this makes most of the lines in the above chart very thin. This wasn't very communicative overall so we didn't use this idea.</p> <img src=images/genres-comparison-graph.b6ecbe99.jpg> <div class="figure-title text-uppercase"> <p>Area chart</p> </div> <p>This representation doesn't allow us to show the most used profanities even though it is quite informative.</p> </section> <section class="social first_section"> <a name=subscribe_bottom></a> <div class="ssk-sm ssk-group ssk-count" data-url="http://lab.musixmatch.com/profanity_genres/" data-text="Followed by Heavy Metal" data-via=Musixmatch> <a href="" class="ssk ssk-facebook"></a> <a href="" class="ssk ssk-twitter"></a> </div> <div class="sign-up center-block"> <div id=mc_embed_signup> <form action="//musixmatch.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4b3001a7018f0f85c4658b0c7&amp;id=222b95fbdf" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class=validate target=_blank novalidate> <div id=mc_embed_signup_scroll> <h2></h2> <!-- <div class="indicates-required">
